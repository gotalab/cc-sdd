# Task Generation Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Natural Language Descriptions
Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not code structure.

**Describe**:
- What functionality to achieve
- Business logic and behavior
- Features and capabilities
- Domain language and concepts
- Data relationships and workflows

**Avoid**:
- File paths and directory structure
- Function/method names and signatures
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Class names and API contracts
- Specific data structures

**Rationale**: Implementation details (files, methods, types) are defined in design.md. Tasks describe the functional work to be done.

### 2. Task Integration & Progression

**Every task must**:
- Build on previous outputs (no orphaned code)
- Connect to the overall system (no hanging features)
- Progress incrementally (no big jumps in complexity)
- Validate core functionality early in sequence

**End with integration tasks** to wire everything together.

### 3. Flexible Task Sizing

**Guidelines**:
- **Major tasks**: As many sub-tasks as logically needed (group by cohesion)
- **Sub-tasks**: 1-3 hours each, 3-10 details per sub-task
- Balance between too granular and too broad

**Don't force arbitrary numbers** - let logical grouping determine structure.

### 4. Requirements Mapping

**End each task detail section with**:
- `_Requirements: X.X, Y.Y_` for specific requirement IDs
- `_Requirements: [description]_` for cross-cutting requirements

### 5. Code-Only Focus

**Include ONLY**:
- Coding tasks (implementation)
- Testing tasks (unit, integration, E2E)
- Technical setup tasks (infrastructure, configuration)

**Exclude**:
- Deployment tasks
- Documentation tasks
- User testing
- Marketing/business activities

## Task Hierarchy Rules

### Maximum 2 Levels
- **Level 1**: Major tasks (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- **Level 2**: Sub-tasks (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2...)
- **No deeper nesting** (no 1.1.1)

### Sequential Numbering
- Major tasks MUST increment: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- Sub-tasks reset per major task: 1.1, 1.2, then 2.1, 2.2...
- Never repeat major task numbers

### Parallel Analysis (default)
- Assume parallel analysis is enabled unless explicitly disabled (e.g. `--sequential` flag).
- Identify tasks that can run concurrently when **all** conditions hold:
  - No data dependency on other pending tasks
  - No shared file or resource contention
  - No prerequisite review/approval from another task
- Append `(P)` immediately after the task number for each parallel-capable task:
  - Example: `- [ ] 2.1 (P) Build background worker`
  - Apply to both major tasks and sub-tasks when appropriate.
- If sequential mode is requested, omit `(P)` markers entirely.
- Group parallel tasks logically (same parent when possible) and highlight any ordering caveats in detail bullets.
- Explicitly call out dependencies that prevent `(P)` even when tasks look similar.

### Checkbox Format
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Major task description
- [ ] 1.1 Sub-task description
  - Detail item 1
  - Detail item 2
  - _Requirements: X.X_

- [ ] 1.2 Sub-task description
  - Detail items...
  - _Requirements: Y.Y_

- [ ] 1.3 Sub-task description
  - Detail items...
  - _Requirements: Z.Z, W.W_

- [ ] 2. Next major task (NOT 1 again!)
- [ ] 2.1 Sub-task...
```

## Requirements Coverage

**Mandatory Check**:
- ALL requirements from requirements.md MUST be covered
- Cross-reference every requirement ID with task mappings
- If gaps found: Return to requirements or design phase
- No requirement should be left without corresponding tasks

Document any intentionally deferred requirements with rationale.
